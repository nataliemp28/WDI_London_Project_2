<h1>Game Set Match - Project 2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This was a group project within a team of four. This was our second project at General Assembly and we were tasked with building a full stack node app, using jQuery on the front end and the Google Maps API.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<p>NodeJS, Mongoose, MongoDB, Google Maps API, jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Trello, Balsamiq, Git/Github</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This was our second project at General Assembly and was our first experience of using Git/Github as a group, this was an interesting learning curve and dealing with the merge conflicts as a group was initially challenging. Our first task was to come up with a concept, as we all had quite different ideas, this took some thinking and planning. It had to be centred around using the Google Maps API so a location based app was key.</p>

<p>After we'd decided on the direction our project was taking, the next step was to draw out some wireframes and discuss the user journey, this involed both using Balsamiq and sketching on the board and discussing ideas. We used a Trello board to track our progress and assign tasks. Two of us primarily worked on the front end, myself and one other group member. We used Bootstrap for the styling, which was a great opportunity for us to learn more about styling and customising a framework. The front end was written in jQuery, using AJAX calls.</p>

<h2>What Next</h2>

<p>We would have liked to add a method of contacting the player through the app, such as some kind of messaging service.</p>
